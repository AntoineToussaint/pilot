//! Nerd Font glyphs for the TUI.
//!
//! These are private-use-area codepoints that render as graphical
//! icons when the user's terminal font has Nerd Font glyph patches.
//! On a non-Nerd-Font terminal they render as `?` or empty boxes —
//! we accept that trade-off because the alternative (a runtime probe
//! and ASCII-fallback table) doubles the maintenance cost for a
//! tiny minority of users.
//!
//! Naming follows the call-site, not the icon (`comment`, not
//! `speech_bubble`), so future icon swaps don't churn every consumer.
