//! Sidebar — the left pane. Lists sessions, owns the cursor, handles
//! the core navigation and session-level keybindings.
//!
//! ## Why one component, not three
//!
//! Decomposing into FilterRow + SessionList + SessionRow components
//! is tempting, but the state is tightly coupled (cursor index depends
//! on visible order, which depends on filter/search/mailbox) and
//! splitting it opens a desync surface across multiple owners. Keeping
//! Sidebar as one component with private state is the simpler correct
//! answer. When a specific part gets independently complicated (custom
//! filter UIs per provider, say), splitting it later is localised.
//!
//! ## State the sidebar owns
//!
//! - `workspaces`: the authoritative map of SessionKey → Workspace.
//!   `SessionKey` is the wire-side selection identifier — we use the
//!   workspace's key string as its value. The daemon is the source
//!   of truth; we mirror what it sends via `Event::WorkspaceUpserted`
//!   / `WorkspaceRemoved` / `Snapshot`.
//! - `visible`: derived — `workspaces` filtered by mailbox and
//!   sorted by primary task's `updated_at` descending. Recomputed
//!   on every change so the user never sees a stale order.
//! - `cursor`: index into `visible`. Preserved by key (not index)
//!   across refreshes — the same row stays under the cursor even
//!   when another workspace gets inserted above it.
//! - `mailbox`: which view we're showing (Inbox vs Snoozed).
//! - `kill_latch` / `merge_latch` / `long_snooze_latch`: two-press
//!   guards for `Shift-X` / `Shift-M` / `Shift-Z`. Each is a
//!   `ConfirmLatch<SessionKey>` (see `crate::confirm_latch`).
