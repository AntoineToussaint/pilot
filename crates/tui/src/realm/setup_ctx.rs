//! `SetupCtx` — grouped state for the setup wizard, settings palette,
//! and editor-open shortcut. These eight fields used to sprawl across
//! `Model`; bundling them here lets the reader see at a glance that
//! they all belong to the same flow.
//!
//! Logic stays on `Model` for now (every method also touches `app`,
//! `modal_stack`, `client`, etc.). That carve-out is a follow-up. The
//! win from this struct alone is a tidier `Model` definition and a
//! single import line for any future code touching setup state.
