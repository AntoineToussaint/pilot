//! `Model` — the realm-side replacement for pilot's `App` struct.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! Panes (Sidebar / Right / Terminals) are **not** mounted into the
//! tuirealm `Application`. They live as typed fields on `Model` and
//! we drive their `view`/`on_event`/`handle_key` directly. tuirealm's
//! `Application` only owns **modals** — that's where its mount/unmount
//! + Z-stack semantics actually pay off.
//!
//! Why: pilot's panes are persistently visible, mutate often, and the
//! orchestrator needs typed handles to drain queued commands. Mounting
//! them via `app.mount(id, Box::new(pane))` hides the concrete type
//! behind `dyn AppComponent` and forces awkward attribute-based
//! round-trips for the simplest "give me the queued commands" calls.
//! Holding them as fields is the cleaner shape.
//!
//! ## Modal stack
//!
//! Modals do go through `Application`. We track a `Vec<Id>` so multi-
//! modal stacking (rare) works, and call `app.active(&id)` whenever
//! the top changes. Modal payloads come back as `Msg`s from
//! `app.tick(...)` and `Model::update` decides what to do.
