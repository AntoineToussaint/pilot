//! Pilot-flavored extras on top of `crate::theme`.
//!
//! The kit ships a generic palette + the `Theme` slots; pilot adds
//! its own state-pill mapping (PR open/closed/merged → bg/fg color
//! pair), conventional-commit kind colors, etc. Lives here rather
//! than inside the kit so the kit stays domain-free.
