//! Wire types for LLM-proxy telemetry. These cross the IPC boundary
//! as `Event::ProxyRecord`, which is why they live in the protocol
//! crate rather than in `pilot-llm-proxy`. The proxy crate re-exports
//! them so existing call sites (`pilot_llm_proxy::ProxyRecord`) keep
//! compiling without churn.
//!
//! Moved here to break the previous inverted dependency
//! (`pilot-ipc → pilot-llm-proxy`). Wire types belong at the bottom
//! of the dependency graph so any consumer (TUI, JSON API gateway,
//! future remote agents) can read records without dragging in hyper
//! / reqwest.
