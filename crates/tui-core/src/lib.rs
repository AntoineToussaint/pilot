//! pilot-tui-core — pure-logic modules used by the TUI client.
//!
//! Ratatui-free by design. The TUI's render-heavy modules
//! (Sidebar, RightPane, TerminalStack, model) live in `pilot-tui`;
//! everything that doesn't need a render context — latches,
//! intent state machines, agent-attention tracking, editor
//! discovery, platform shims, setup helpers, test-mode harness —
//! lives here so edits to those modules don't trigger a full
//! pilot-tui rebuild.
