//! LLM proxy — transparent pass-through that records structured
//! telemetry from agent API traffic.
//!
//! **Rationale.** Scraping PTY frames for "what did the agent just do"
//! works for coarse state (working vs asking) but falls apart for
//! anything structured: tokens, tool calls, cost, assistant text for
//! search. The agent is already speaking a well-defined JSON protocol
//! to Anthropic / OpenAI. Proxying that protocol gives us reliable,
//! structured data for free.
//!
//! **Boundaries.** The proxy is deliberately read-only. It forwards
//! requests byte-for-byte (modulo adding our session tag header) and
//! forwards responses byte-for-byte. It never rewrites model names,
//! never swaps providers, never modifies tool results. Observability
//! only — so users can trust the agent is doing exactly what it
//! claims.
//!
//! **Trust.** Binds `127.0.0.1:<ephemeral>` only. Never accepts remote
//! connections. User's API key lives in the agent's env and hits the
//! proxy in the `Authorization` header; the proxy forwards it verbatim
//! and doesn't log auth headers.
//!
//! This module currently ships the types that the daemon and SQLite
//! layer persist. The hyper server that binds the port and forwards
//! upstream traffic lands together with the daemon integration — see
//! tasks #68 and #69 in the roadmap.
